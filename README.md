# Calculator

This code is a simple calculator application built using the Kivy library for Python. The application has a graphical user interface where the user can interact with the calculator to perform various arithmetic operations.

These are the imports needed for the code. kivy.app is the base class for creating Kivy applications. kivy.uix.widget provides the building blocks for the GUI. kivy.core.window provides access to the Window object. kivy.lang.builder provides a mechanism for loading a user interface from a string.

This code is defining the user interface for a calculator application using the Kivy library. The interface is defined using a special language called Kivy Language (kv) and contains a series of widgets (buttons, text input boxes, etc.) and their associated properties (text, font size, background color, etc.).

The Builder.load_string() method is used to load the kv code as a string and build the interface from it.

The code defines two widgets:

<Button> widget: This widget is used to define the appearance and behavior of the calculator buttons. It has the following properties:
size_hint: The size of the button as a fraction of its parent widget's size.
background_normal: The path to the normal background image of the button (empty string means no background image).
background_color: The background color of the button in RGB format.
<CalculatorWidget> widget: This is the main widget that contains all other widgets in the calculator interface. It has the following properties:
BoxLayout: Specifies that the widget will have a box layout (i.e., widgets will be arranged in either a horizontal or vertical box).
orientation: Specifies the orientation of the box layout (i.e., horizontal or vertical).
size: The size of the widget in pixels.
The <CalculatorWidget> widget contains two child widgets:

TextInput widget: This widget is used to display the input and output of the calculator. It has the following properties:
id: The unique identifier of the widget.
text: The text to be displayed in the widget.
font_size: The size of the font used to display the text.
multiline: Specifies whether the widget allows multiple lines of text.
halign: Specifies the horizontal alignment of the text (i.e., left, center, or right).
size_hint: The size of the widget as a fraction of its parent widget's size.
background_color: The background color of the widget in RGBA format.
GridLayout widget: This widget is used to arrange the calculator buttons in a grid. It has the following properties:
cols: The number of columns in the grid.
rows: The number of rows in the grid.
The GridLayout widget contains 20 child widgets (Button widgets), arranged in 5 rows and 4 columns. Each Button widget has the following properties:

text: The text to be displayed on the button.
font_size: The size of the font used to display the text.
on_press: The function to be called when the button is pressed.
background_color: The background color of the button in RGBA format. This property is only set for certain buttons to give them a different appearance from the other buttons (e.g., the equals button is red while the other buttons are blue).
  
  class CalculatorWidget(Widget):

This is the main class of the app that inherits from the Kivy Widget class.
All the calculator functions are defined within this class.
def clear(self):

This function is called when the "C" button is pressed.
It sets the text of the input box to "0".
def button_value(self,number):

This function is called when any number button (0-9) is pressed.
It gets the previous number entered by the user and concatenates the new number to it.
If the previous number is "0", it replaces it with the new number.
def remove_last(self):

This function is called when the backspace button ("<<") is pressed.
It gets the previous number entered by the user and removes the last character.
def signs(self,sign):

This function is called when any of the operator buttons (+, -, *, /, %) is pressed.
It gets the previous number entered by the user and concatenates the operator to it.
def results(self):

This function is called when the "=" button is pressed.
It gets the previous number entered by the user, evaluates it as a Python expression using the eval() function, and displays the result in the input box.
If the expression is invalid, it displays "Wrong Equation" in the input box.
def positive_negative(self):

This function is called when the "+/-" button is pressed.
It gets the previous number entered by the user and changes its sign.
def dot(self):

This function is called when the "." button is pressed.
It checks if the last entered number already has a decimal point or not.
If not, it adds a decimal point to the end of the number.
class CalculatorApp(App):

This is the main app class that inherits from the Kivy App class.
It is responsible for building the user interface of the app.
def build(self):

This function is called when the app is launched.
It returns an instance of the CalculatorWidget class.
if __name__ == "__main__":

This checks if the current module is being executed as the main program.
If yes, it creates an instance of the CalculatorApp class and runs the app using the run() method.
